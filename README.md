Hello bruh. This code is the skeleton code for our node express Jira lookalike.
The app.js folder is the one containing the backend logic for node and express.
The public folder contains the static html,css, and javascript files for the website.
This app is basic and has two html pages, index and about. Both are pages that contain some text and some buttons.

index.html has two buttons one redirects to the about page and the other displays a notificaton on your browser.
about.html has one button that redirects you to the index.html page.

For you to run this code, there are a couple of requirements:

*********
1. You should have nodejs installed on your laptop/PC and preferably the latest
2. After getting this code, go to your terminal and run 'npm install express'
3. Run the command 'npm install nodemon'
4. Run the command 'npm i bcrypt'
5. Run the command 'npm i mysql2'
6. Run the command 'npm i express-session'
7. Run the command 'npm i ejs'
8. run the command 'npm run start-dev' and enjoy

The website should be hosted on http://localhost:3000
